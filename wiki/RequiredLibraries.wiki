=Overall functionality=
  * The most recent version of PHP 5 is suggested, as some PHP 5-only functions are used in certain sections of the code
  * MySQL 5 and, as of 0.3.0, SQLite are the only supported DBIs
  * The GD image library (typically part of PHP) is required to thumbnail images.
  * The Smarty template engine is no longer included with drydock and must be downloaded separately 

=Admin functions=
  * PHP with libcurl enabled is currently required to automate [http://wakaba.c3.cx/antispam/ the blacklisting of certain keywords].  However, placing URLs, one for each line, in a file named "spam.txt" in the /unlinked/ folder will achieve the same result.  One may even use both simultaneously, in case there are specific URLs that one wishes to block _in addition_ to those provided by WAHa.06x36.

=Posting functions=
  * Certain PEAR modules are required for SVG support, and optional for SWF support depending on the configuration (see below).
  * ImageMagick or rsvg may be installed for SVG thumbnailing, depending on the configured thumbnailer

=PEAR modules required==
  * For SWF metadata functionality, [http://www.sephiroth.it/swfreader.php File_SWF] is required and must be installed in *<PEAR path>/File/*.  Note that this is only required if the SWF metadata option is enabled.
  * For SVG functionality, two PEAR modules are required:
    * [http://pear.php.net/package/XML_HTMLSax3 XML_HTMLSax3] must be installed in *<PEAR path>/XML/*.
    * [http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_Safe HTML_Safe] must be installed in *<PEAR path>/HTML/HTML_Safe/*.
