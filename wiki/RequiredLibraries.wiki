#summary Required Libraries
=Overall functionality=
  * PHP5 is suggested, although we have run the script with few hiccups under PHP4.4.  However it is recommended you use the most recent stable version.
  * MySQL is currently the only supported DBI.
  * The GD image library (typically part of PHP) is required to thumbnail images.

=Admin functions=
  * PHP with libcurl enabled is currently required to automate [http://wakaba.c3.cx/antispam/ the blacklisting of certain keywords].  A workaround is available by placing the black list file in the unlinked/ directory.
=Posting functions=
  * Certain PEAR modules are required for SWF metadata and SVG support.
  * ImageMagick is required for SVG support (but in the future rsvg will be an acceptable alternative)
